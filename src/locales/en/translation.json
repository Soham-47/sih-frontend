    "fullContent": "Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops in India, providing staple food and livelihood for millions of farmers. Mastering modern cultivation techniques can significantly improve yield and profit.\n\n1. Land Preparation\n\nWheat requires well-prepared soil for uniform germination and high yields. Begin land preparation early to retain moisture and ensure good tilth.\n\n- Conventional tillage: Deep plowing with a moldboard/disc plow followed by harrowing and leveling.\n- Conservation tillage: Zero/minimum tillage is highly effective, especially after rice, saving time, fuel, and labor.\n- Laser land leveling: Ensures uniform irrigation and better water-use efficiency.\n\n2. Water Management\n\nWheat typically needs 4â€“6 irrigations (350â€“550 mm water), depending on soil and rainfall. Critical stages:\n- Crown root initiation\n- Tillering\n- Jointing\n- Flowering\n- Milk and dough stages\n\nMethods:\n- Sprinkler irrigation: Widely adopted due to close plant spacing.\n- Drip irrigation: Saves ~37% water while maintaining yield.\n- Flood irrigation: Still common, especially in large fields, but less efficient.\n\n3. Weed Management\n\nWeeds cause up to 30% yield loss if unmanaged.\n\nCultural practices: Early sowing (Octâ€“Nov), certified seeds, and closer row spacing.\n\nHerbicides:\n- Pre-emergence: Pendimethalin, Metribuzin\n- Post-emergence: Clodinafop, Sulfosulfuron, Mesosulfuron + Iodosulfuron\n- Herbicide mixtures are recommended for diverse weed control.\n\n4. Planting and Sowing\n\n- Winter wheat: Sown mid-Sept to Oct, using grain drills at 1â€“1.5 inch depth.\n- Spring wheat: Sown in early spring, grows faster (100â€“130 days).\n\nMethods:\n- Drilling/line sowing is preferred for uniformity.\n- Broadcasting works if drills arenâ€™t available.\n\nSeeding rate: ~100â€“150 kg/ha (varies with sowing time and variety).\n\n5. Fertilization\n\nBalanced fertilization is crucial for productivity.\n\n- General dose: 120:60:40 kg/ha of N:Pâ‚‚Oâ‚…:Kâ‚‚O.\n- Split nitrogen application: At sowing, tillering, and jointing stages.\n- Organic manures (FYM/compost) improve soil structure.\n\n6. Soil Requirements\n\n- Best suited for loam or clay loam soils with pH 6.0â€“7.5.\n- Avoid waterlogging; ensure good drainage.\n- Incorporate organic matter to improve fertility and structure.\n\n7. Climatic Conditions\n\n- Optimal temperature: 21â€“24Â°C for growth.\n- Minimum: ~4Â°C, Maximum: >35Â°C reduces yield.\n- Requires 50â€“75 cm well-distributed rainfall.\n- Prefers cool, dry winters with bright sunshine at maturity.\n\n8. Pest and Disease Management\n\nMajor pests: Aphids, termites, grasshoppers, armyworms.\nMajor diseases: Rusts (yellow, brown, black), powdery mildew, smuts.\n\nControl strategies:\n- Use resistant varieties.\n- Apply fungicides like propiconazole when symptoms appear.\n- Adopt Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.\n\n9. Variety Selection (India)\n\n- DBW 296: High yield, rust resistant.\n- HD 3226: Good gluten quality, multiple disease resistance.\n- WH 1270: Very high yield potential.\n- PBW 771: Suitable for late sowing, 120-day maturity.\n\n10. Harvesting\n\n- Harvest when 85â€“90% of the crop turns golden and grains are hard.\n- Grain moisture at harvest: 13â€“15%.\n- Delay beyond optimum increases shattering and reduces grain quality.\n\n11. Post-Harvest Management\n\n- Drying: Reduce grain moisture to 12â€“13% for safe storage.\n- Storage: Use silos or well-aerated warehouses; maintain <17Â°C and <67% humidity.\n- Pest control: Regular cleaning, fumigation if necessary."

    "fullContent": "Rice is Indiaâ€™s most important food crop, feeding more than half the population. With good practices, farmers can grow more rice, spend less money, and protect the soil for future generations.\n\n1. Land Preparation\n\nStart ploughing 2â€“3 weeks before sowing to mix crop residues and control weeds.\n\nLevel fields properly â€” laser or plank leveling saves 20â€“25% water and helps rice grow evenly.\n\nFor lowland paddy, puddling (mixing soil with standing water) helps seedlings establish better and reduces weeds.\n\n2. Water Management\n\nRice needs a lot of water, but wastage can be reduced.\n\nAlternate Wetting and Drying (AWD): allow water to dry 2â€“3 cm below soil before irrigating again. Saves 15â€“25% water.\n\nIn water-scarce areas, try System of Rice Intensification (SRI) â€” younger seedlings, wider spacing, and less water â†’ higher yield.\n\nProper bunding of fields prevents water loss.\n\n3. Weed & Pest Management\n\nUse certified seeds and keep fields clean from roadside weeds.\n\nFlooding fields with 2â€“5 cm water during early growth controls many weeds.\n\nRotate rice with pulses or vegetables to break pest cycles.\n\nFor pests like stem borer or brown planthopper:\n- Use pheromone traps or light traps.\n- Grow resistant varieties available locally.\n- Avoid excess urea â€” too much nitrogen invites pests.\n\n4. Sowing & Fertilization\n\nTransplanting is most common and gives 2â€“3 times higher yield than broadcasting.\n\nMaintain spacing of 20x20 cm with 2â€“3 seedlings per hill.\n\nUse balanced fertilizers (NPK) â€” apply in 3 splits (basal, mid-tillering, panicle initiation).\n\nAdd organic manure, compost, or green manuring (like dhaincha or sunhemp) to improve soil fertility.\n\n5. Harvesting & Storage\n\nHarvest when 80â€“85% grains turn yellow and grain moisture is 20â€“25%.\n\nUse sickle, combine harvester, or reaper depending on scale.\n\nDry grains to 14% moisture before storage to avoid fungus.\n\nStore in airtight containers or gunny bags lined with polythene.\n\nKeep storage areas dry and fumigate if needed to avoid weevils.\n\nâœ… Farmer Tip:\nIn India, rice yields can improve by 10â€“20% with field leveling, water-saving methods (AWD/SRI), soil testing before fertilizer use, and better post-harvest handling. This not only increases income but also saves natural resources."
